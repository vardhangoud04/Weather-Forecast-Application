            the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time.

            <p id='para-2'>People haveattempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since
            the 19th century.</p>
            <p className='para-3' >Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere,
             land, and ocean and using meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change at a given place.</p>
             <p className='para-4'> Hence, forecasts become less accurate as the difference between current time and the time for which the forecast 
              is being made (the range of the forecast) increases.</p>
